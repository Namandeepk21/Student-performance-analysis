# Student-performance-analysis
This project explores student performance using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels. It analyzes gender-wise scores, test preparation impact, and parental education effects. Visuals include bar plots, pie charts, and regression plots.  ✅ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels 
# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

A data analysis project using *Pandas, **NumPy, **Matplotlib, and **Seaborn* to explore how various factors like gender, parental education, and test preparation impact student performance in math, reading, and writing.

---

## 📁 Dataset
*Name:* StudentsPerformance.csv  
This dataset contains information about student scores and associated demographic factors:
- gender
- race/ethnicity
- parental level of education
- lunch
- test preparation course
- math score
- reading score
- writing score

---

## 💡 Objective
To perform an in-depth *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and uncover hidden patterns and relationships between different features and student performance.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Pandas
- 🔢 NumPy
- 📈 Matplotlib
- 🎨 Seaborn
- 📂 Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Exploration
- Checked missing/null values
- Explored data structure using .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()

### ✅ Visualizations
- *Pie Chart* of students who passed/failed math
- *Bar Plots* comparing scores by gender and parental education
- *Line Plot* of scores vs test preparation
- *Heatmap* to see score correlations

### ✅ Insights
- Students who *completed the test preparation course* scored higher on average.
- *Female students* performed better in reading and writing.
- Parental education level affects student performance.

---

## 🔢 Statistical Insights
Used *NumPy* for calculating:
- Mean, median, and standard deviation of scores
- Pass/fail rate using thresholds (e.g., 40 marks)

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add *predictive models* (e.g., logistic regression)
